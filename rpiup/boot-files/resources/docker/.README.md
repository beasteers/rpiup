# This is where you can put docker containers to be automatically installed.

They should follow the structure:

```
/boot/resources/docker/
    {name}/
        setup.sh : an arbitrary script to do any prep work for the container.
                   most of the time this should not be necessary.
                   If this script has a non-zero exit code, then the
                   container will not be created.
        docker-compose.yml : defines your docker containers
```


---
For reference, they are started by doing:
```bash
cd /boot/resources/docker/{name}
[ -f ./setup.sh ] && (setup.sh || continue)
docker-compose up -d
```

## Example

##### myapp/setup.sh
```bash
REQUIRED_FILE=/path/to/file.conf
[ -e $REQUIRED_FILE ]  # if the file doesn't exist, don't start the container
```
##### myapp/docker-compose.yml
```yaml
version: '2.4'

services:
  myapp:
    image: myapp/myapp:latest
    volumes: ...
    environment: ...

```
