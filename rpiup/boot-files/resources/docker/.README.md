# This is where you can put docker containers to be automatically installed.

They should follow the structure:

```
/boot/resources/docker/
    {name}/
        docker-compose.yml : defines your docker containers
```


---
For reference, they are started by doing:
```bash
cd /boot/resources/docker/{name}
docker-compose up -d
```
