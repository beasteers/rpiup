# This is where you can put systemctl services to be automatically installed.

They should follow the structure:

```
/boot/resources/services/
    {service_name}/
        install.sh : this is a script where you can put things like
                     (apt-get, mv, chmod, etc.). whatever you need to
                     do before the service can run.
        {service_name}.service : this is your systemctl service file
```

### Example - piwatcher

##### piwatcher/install.sh
```bash
# install piwatcher command
wget -N http://omzlo.com/downloads/piwatcher
chmod a+x piwatcher && mv piwatcher /usr/local/bin/
# add piwatcher monitoring script
