# This is where you can put systemctl services to be automatically installed.

They should follow the structure:

```
/boot/resources/services/
    {service_name}/
        setup.sh : this is a script where you can put things like
                   (apt-get, mv, chmod, etc.). whatever you need to
                   do before the service can run.
                   If this script has a non-zero exit code, then the 
                   service will not be installed.
        {service_name}.service : this is your systemctl service file
```
