# OpenVPN Configuration

This is where you put your OpenVPN client configuration.

This expects at least one certificate matching `{name}.conf`:
```
/boot/resources/vpn/
    server1.conf
    server2.conf
```

If there are more than one configuration, they will all be started.

If no certificates are present at first boot, then openvpn will not be installed.


You can specify a script at `/boot/resources/vpn/setup.sh` to acquire/prepare the certificates if necessary.
