# rpiup addons

TODO: This is not currently managed via the python CLI.

This is where we can add additional file layers that can be optionally overlayed on top of the boot-files directory.

For example, you could have an addon like this:
```
addons/
    someapp/
        README.md
        someapp.conf
        docker/
            anapp/
                docker-compose.yml
```

And the contents of `someapp/` will be copied on top of a user's `boot-files` directory.

>**NOTE:** I don't intend to do file diffs. The idea is that addons and the core should make an effort to not clobber each other by either saving to their own directories or by using addon-specific file naming. I don't have a plan for apps that modify existing files, but I'm hoping it won't be necessary.

For installing arbitrary scripts use:
```
someapp/.internal/
    pre-scripts/
        someapp.sh : a script to run before any of the core installs
    scripts/
        someapp.sh : a script to run after any of the core installs
```
